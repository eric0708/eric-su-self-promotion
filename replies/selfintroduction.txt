My thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. Always looking for more to learn, 
I treasure every opportunity to broaden my horizons. I not only persist 
in my studies, but also in various researches and projects. I also make 
great effort on conducting book clubs to discuss the latest knowledge and 
technology with my peers. By learning together as a group, we can achieve 
a lot more than by oneself, and I believe everyone has merits that I can 
learn from. To accommodate so much into my time, I always plan ahead of 
time effectively and efficiently. Through the internship program, I wish to 
learn more at the data position to further enhance my ability and become 
a successful and well-rounded engineer.
